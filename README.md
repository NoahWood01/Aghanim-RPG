# Aghanim-RPG
This is an Unreal Engine Game built with C++ and with inspiration from Valve's DotA 2.

Features a combat system of spells and melee attacks, animations, attributes, leveling/experience, inventory, and quest system, with accompanying UI, all from a Third Person Viewpoint. 

Note: Only project files like code and Unreal Blueprints are stored here for source control. It is missing all meshes, textures, etc. as it would be too big to store.
